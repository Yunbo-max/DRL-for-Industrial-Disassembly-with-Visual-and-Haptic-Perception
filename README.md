## üìù Project Description
This research investigates autonomous robotic disassembly using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with multimodal perception (vision + haptics). The system was tested on a door chain disassembly task, demonstrating:

- 80% faster learning convergence compared to baseline methods
- 30% improvement in task success rate with multimodal perception
- Critical impact of reward function design on learning stability

## üöÄ Installation Guide

### 1. Base System Setup
```bash
# Minimum 20GB storage required
# Follow VMware+Ubuntu installation guide:
https://blog.csdn.net/qq_45642410/article/details/113756950
```

### Core Dependencies
# Create conda environment
conda create -n Robotics python=3.9
conda activate Robotics

# Install essential tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential manpages-dev patchelf
gcc --version  # Verify installation

# Install Mujoco
cd ~/.mujoco/mujoco200/bin
./simulate ../model/humanoid.xml  # Test installation

# Install robotics packages
pip install robosuite mujoco-py pybullet gym open3d h5py pygame

The specific steps are shwon below with the solution to the common problems:

1. The installation of VMware and Linux Ubuntu20.04 can be seen from https://blog.csdn.net/qq_45642410/article/details/113756950 and the point is that the storage should be more than 20GB at least .

2. The rest of the steps on other softwares are shown in https://shirkozlovsky1.medium.com/setup-robosouite-pycharm-enviroment-on-linux-5dd0d3b8e4f0.
But there are lot of problems to be mentioned:

For the Mujoco, at last, please enter in the terminal ./simulate ../model/humanoid.xml on the path /.mujoco/mujoco200/bin

For the Python3.9 and Anaconda3, it is extreme significant to create a new environment (the edition of the python should be larger than 3.8) in its navigator and install the rest of softewares in the terminal like this one,where Robotics is the name of the new environment.

For the pycharm, the point is the setting of the environmental variables. The specific steps are shown here.

However, the libgrew.so name here can be different for various computers. It can be the libGLEW.so or libGLEW2.so. And the path of these two in the picture should be the actual path in your computer.

For the Mujoco_py, it is also necessary to install the gcc module by:
~sudo apt update
~sudo apt install build-essential
~sudo apt-get install manpages-dev
~gcc --version
To validate the gcc.
